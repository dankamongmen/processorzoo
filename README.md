The Processor Zoo aims to be as complete and thorough as possible an open
source XML database of microprocessors. It also contains RELAX-NG schemata for
validating the input, XPATH1 tools for querying the database, and XSLT tools
for transforming this data. Later, an open source library will be built
combining this information with runtime architecture detection to provide a
complete, portable hardware modeling interface suitable for compiler authors
and programmers concerned with system-specific performance.
